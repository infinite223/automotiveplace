<h2>AMP - Automotive place</h2>

The application is a better version of  <a href="https://carsdesigns.netlify.app/">cars design</a>, offering much more functionality which will make the app very useful for people who are interested in cars.

The project will be much more polished than its predecessor, created in a more modern and interesting technology, in addition it will have its own backend, and the application architecture will be much more thought out.
